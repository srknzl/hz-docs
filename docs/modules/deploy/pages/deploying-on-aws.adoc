= Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS
:description: Deploy Hazelcast clusters on Amazon AWS EC2 and AWS ECS/Fargate environments and allow them to discover each other automatically.

{description}

== Prerequisites

Before deploying Hazelcast on AWS, you must have the following:

* Linux Kernel 3.19+
+
TCP connections may get stuck when used with older Kernel versions, resulting in undefined timeouts.

== Discovering Members Automatically

To make it easier to set up clusters on Amazon AWS, Hazelcast allows members to discover each other automatically, using discovery strategies.

When a member starts on AWS, it fetches a list of all running instances filtered by the member's AWS configuration settings. Then, each instance is checked one-by-one with its IP and each of the ports defined in the `hz-port` property. When a member is discovered under `IP:PORT`, then it joins the cluster.

Choose from one of the following environments to configure a discovery strategy:

- EC2
- ECS/Fargate
- ECS/EC2
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

== EC2 Configuration

You can configure both Hazelcast members and Hazelcast clients to discover clusters automatically.

=== EC2 Hazelcast Member Discovery

You can configure Hazelcast in one of the following manners.

-- 
```xml
<hazelcast>
  <network>
    <join>
      <multicast enabled="false"/>
      <aws enabled="true">
        <tag-key>my-ec2-instance-tag-key</tag-key>
        <tag-value>my-ec2-instance-tag-value</tag-value>
      </aws>
    </join>
  </network>
</hazelcast>
```
--
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
```yaml
hazelcast:
  network:
    join:
      multicast:
        enabled: false
      aws:
        enabled: true
        tag-key: my-ec2-instance-tag-key
        tag-value: my-ec2-instance-tag-value
```
--
Java:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getAwsConfig().setEnabled(true)
      .setProperty("tag-key", "my-ec2-instance-tag-key")
      .setProperty("tag-value", "my-ec2-instance-tag-value");
```
--
====

The following optional properties can be configured:

* `access-key`, `secret-key`: access and secret keys of your AWS account; if not set, `iam-role` is used
* `iam-role`: IAM Role attached to EC2 instance used to fetch credentials (if `access-key`/`secret-key` not specified); if not set, default IAM Role attached to EC2 instance is used
* `region`: region where Hazelcast members are running; default is the current region
* `host-header`: `ec2`, `ecs`, or the URL of a EC2/ECS API endpoint; automatically detected by default
* `security-group-name`: filter to look only for EC2 instances with the given security group
* `tag-key`, `tag-value`: filter to look only for EC2 Instances with the given `tag-key`/`tag-value`; multi values supported if comma-separated (e.g. `KeyA,KeyB`); comma-separated values behaves as AND conditions
* `connection-timeout-seconds`, `read-timeout-seconds`: connection and read timeouts when making a call to AWS API; default to `10`
* `connection-retries`: number of retries while connecting to AWS API; default to `3`
* `hz-port`: a range of ports where the plugin looks for Hazelcast members; default is `5701-5708`

Note that if you don't specify any of the properties, then Hazelcast uses the IAM Role assigned to the EC2 Instance to form a cluster from all Hazelcast members running in same region.

=== EC2 Hazelcast Client Configuration

Hazelcast Client discovery parameters are the same as mentioned above.

If Hazelcast Client is run *outside AWS*, then you need to always specify the following parameters:

- `access-key`, `secret-key` - IAM role cannot be used from outside AWS
- `region` - it cannot be detected automatically
- `use-public-ip` - must be set to `true`

Note also that your EC2 instances must have public IP assigned.

Following are example declarative and programmatic configuration snippets.

      .setProperty("tag-value", "my-ec2-instance-tag-value")
      .setProperty("use-public-ip", "true");
```

== ECS/Fargate Configuration

The plugin works both for *Hazelcast Member Discovery* (forming Hazelcast cluster) and *Hazelcast Client Discovery*.

NOTE: For the detailed description, check out link:https://guides.hazelcast.org/ecs-embedded[Hazelcast Guides: Getting Started with Embedded Hazelcast on ECS].

=== ECS Hazelcast Member Discovery

Make sure that your IAM Task Role has the following permissions:

* `ecs:ListTasks`
* `ecs:DescribeTasks`
* `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` (needed only if task have public IPs)

Then, you can configure Hazelcast in one of the following manners. Please note that `10.0.*.*` value depends on your VPC CIDR block definition.

      interfaces:
        - 10.0.*.*
```

```
--

The following optional properties can be configured:

* `access-key`, `secret-key`: access and secret keys of AWS your account; if not set, IAM Task Role is used
* `region`: region where Hazelcast members are running; default is the current region
* `cluster`: ECS cluster short name or ARN; default is the current cluster
* `family`: filter to look only for ECS tasks with the given family name; mutually exclusive with `service-name`
* `service-name`: filter to look only for ECS tasks from the given service; mutually exclusive with `family`
* `host-header`: `ecs` or the URL of a ECS API endpoint; automatically detected by default
* `connection-timeout-seconds`, `read-timeout-seconds`: connection and read timeouts when making a call to AWS API; default to `10`
* `connection-retries`: number of retries while connecting to AWS API; default to `3`
* `hz-port`: a range of ports where the plugin looks for Hazelcast members; default is `5701-5708`

Note that if you don't specify any of the properties, then the plugin discovers all Hazelcast members running in the current ECS cluster.

=== ECS Hazelcast Client Configuration

Hazelcast Client discovery parameters are the same as mentioned above.

If Hazelcast Client is run *outside ECS cluster*, then you need to always specify the following parameters:

- `access-key`
- `secret-key` - IAM role cannot be used from outside AWS
- `region` - it cannot be detected automatically
- `cluster` - it cannot be detected automatically
- `use-public-ip` - must be set to `true`

Note also that your ECS Tasks must have public IPs assigned and your IAM Task Role must have `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` permission.

Following are example declarative and programmatic configuration snippets.

      .setProperty("region", "eu-central-1")
      .setProperty("cluster", "my-cluster")
      .setProperty("use-public-ip", "true");
```

== ECS Environment with EC2 Discovery

If you use ECS on EC2 instances (not Fargate), you may also set up your ECS Tasks to use `host` network mode and then use EC2 discovery mode instead of ECS. In that case, your Hazelcast configuration would look as follows.

```yaml
hazelcast:
  network:
    join:
      multicast:
        enabled: false
      aws:
        enabled: true
        host-header: ec2
    interfaces:
      enabled: true
      interfaces:
        - 10.0.*.*
```

All other parameters can be used exactly the same as described in the EC2-related section.

== AWS Elastic Beanstalk

While deploying your application into the Java Platform, please make sure your Elastic Beanstalk Environment Configuration satisfies the following requirements:

* EC2 security groups contain a group which allows the port `5701`
* IAM instance profile contains IAM role which has `ec2:DescribeInstances` permission (or your Hazelcast configuration contains `access-key` and `secret-key`)
* Deployment policy is `Rolling` (instead of the default `All at once` which may cause the whole Hazelcast members to restart at the same time and therefore lose data)

== Preventing Data Loss

By default, Hazelcast distributes partition replicas (backups) randomly and equally among cluster members. However, this is not safe in terms of high availability when a partition and its replicas are stored on the same rack, using the same network, or power source. To deal with that, Hazelcast offers logical partition grouping, so that a partition
itself and its backups would not be stored within the same group. This way Hazelcast guarantees that a possible failure
affecting more than one member at a time will not cause data loss. For more details about partition groups, see xref:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[Partition Group Configuration].

In addition to two built-in grouping options `ZONE_AWARE` and `PLACEMENT_AWARE`, you can customize the formation of
these groups based on the network interfaces of members. For more details about custom groups, see
xref:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[Custom Partition Groups].

=== Multi-Zone Deployments

If `ZONE_AWARE` partition group is enabled, the backups of a partition are always stored in a different availability
zone. Hazelcast supports the `ZONE_AWARE` feature for both EC2 and ECS.

NOTE: When using the `ZONE_AWARE` partition grouping, a cluster spanning multiple Availability Zones (AZ) should have an equal number of members in each AZ. Otherwise, it will result in uneven partition distribution among
the members.

=== Partition Placement Group Deployments

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-partition[AWS Partition Placement Group]
(PPG) ensures low latency between the instances in the same partition of a placement group
and also provides availability since no two partitions share the same underlying hardware. As long as the partitions of a 
PPG contain an equal number of instances, it will be good practice for Hazelcast clusters formed within a single zone.

If EC2 instances belong to a PPG and `PLACEMENT_AWARE` partition group is enabled, then Hazelcast members will be grouped
by the partitions of the PPG. For instance, the Hazelcast members in the first partition of a PPG named `ppg` will belong
to the partition group of `ppg-1`, and those in the second partition will belong to `ppg-2` and so on. Furthermore, these
groups will be specific to each availability zone. That is, they are formed with zone names as well: `us-east-1-ppg-1`,
`us-east-2-ppg-1`, and the like. However, if a Hazelcast cluster spans multiple availability zones then you should
consider using `ZONE_AWARE`.

=== Cluster Placement Group Deployments

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-cluster[AWS Cluster Placement Group]
(CPG) ensures low latency by packing instances close together inside an availability zone.
If you favor latency over availability, then CPG will serve your purpose.

NOTE: In the case of CPG, using `PLACEMENT_AWARE` has no effect, so can use the default Hazelcast partition group
strategy.

=== Spread Placement Group Deployments

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-spread[AWS Spread Placement Groups]
(SPG) ensures high availability in a single zone by placing each instance in a group on a
distinct rack. It provides better latency than multi-zone deployment, but worse than Cluster Placement Group. SPG is
limited to 7 instances, so if you need a larger Hazelcast cluster within a single zone, you should use PPG instead.

NOTE: In the case of SPG, using `PLACEMENT_AWARE` has no effect, so can use the default Hazelcast partition group
strategy.

== Autoscaling

Hazelcast is prepared to work correctly within the autoscaling environments. Note that there are two specific requirements to prevent Hazelcast from losing data:

* The number of members in a cluster must not change by more than one at a time
* When a member is launched or terminated, the cluster must be in a safe state
