= Scaling and Upgrading Hazelcast Clusters in Kubernetes
:description: Scale up or down your Hazelcast cluster and upgrade all members, using rolling upgrades.

{description}

== Scaling a Cluster

To scale a Hazelcast cluster in Kubernetes, use the standard `kubectl scale` command to change the cluster size.

== Upgrading a Cluster

To upgrade your cluster to a new version of Hazelcast, update the Hazelcast version in your Deployment or StatefulSet configuration, then use the standard `kubectl scale` command.

To upgrade a running cluster, you must have xref:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc[rolling upgrades] enabled.

WARNING: By default, Hazelcast does not shutdown gracefully. As a result, if you suddenly terminate more members than your configured `backup-count` property (1 by default), you may lose cluster data. To prevent data loss during an upgrade, see xref:configuring-kubernetes.adoc#preventing-data-loss-during-upgrades[Preventing Data Loss During Upgrades]
