:description: Deploy a Hazelcast cluster in cloud environments including Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure.

{description}

All these environments support the following features:

- Allow members to discover each other automatically without static IP configuration.
- Prevent data loss by creating partition backups in other Availability Zones (AZ).

== Hazelcast AWS

Deploy a Hazelcast application on https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services].

To deploy a cluster on Amazon EC2, ECS/EC2, or ECS/Fargate, see xref:deploy:deploying-on-aws.adoc[].

To deploy a cluster on Amazon EKS/Fargate or EKS/EC2, see xref:deploy:deploying-in-kubernetes.adoc[].

[[hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-azure]]
== Hazelcast Azure

Deploy a Hazelcast application on https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/[Microsoft Azure^]:

[[hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-kubernetes]]
== Hazelcast Kubernetes

Deploy a Hazelcast application in https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes^] environments, including the following that we have tested: GKE, EKS, AKS, OpenShift, IBM Cloud, Minikube.

See xref:deploy:deploying-in-kubernetes.adoc[].

== Other Cloud Environments
