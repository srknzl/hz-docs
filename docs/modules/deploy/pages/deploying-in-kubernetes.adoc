= Kubernetes Deployment Overview
:description: Discover ways to deploy Hazelcast clusters in Kubernetes environments.

[[deploying-in-kubernetes]]

{description}

== Prerequisites

Before deploying Hazelcast on Kubernetes, consider the following:

* Your Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must support TLS 1.2, which is the case for most modern JREs.
* We recommend using Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSet^] for managing Hazelcast Pods. If you use Deployment (or ReplicationController), your Hazelcast cluster may start with a split brain, but will eventually recover to form one consistent cluster within a few minutes.

== Limitations

Hazelcast CP Subsystem can be used safely in Kubernetes only if xref:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc#cp-subsystem-configuration[CP Subsystem Persistence] is enabled (Enterprise Feature). Otherwise, a CP Subsystem Group may not recover after scaling the cluster or performing the rolling upgrade operation.

== Quickstart

If you just want to play with Hazelcast on Kubernetes, execute the following commands to create a Hazelcast cluster
with 3 members in the `default` namespace using the `default` Service Account.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/master/kubernetes-rbac.yaml
kubectl run hazelcast-1 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
kubectl run hazelcast-2 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
kubectl run hazelcast-3 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----

Hazelcast members <<discovering-members-in-kubernetes-automatically, automatically discover themselves>> and form one Hazelcast cluster.

NOTE: For production-grade Kubernetes deployment, use Helm chart or Kubernetes/OpenShift Operator.

== Helm Chart

https://helm.sh/[Helm^] is a package manager for Kubernetes. Hazelcast is distributed in a form of Helm Charts:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast[hazelcast/hazelcast^]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-enterprise[hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise^]

See the https://github.com/hazelcast/charts[Hazelcast Helm Charts documentation^]
for more details.

== Kubernetes/OpenShift Operator

Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes which help you create and manage your applications.
You can deploy and manage Hazelcast using the following Operators:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator[hazelcast/hazelcast-operator^]: Hazelcast Operator hosted on Docker Hub
* https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator[hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator^]: Red Hat certified Hazelcast Enterprise Operator hosted on Docker Hub
* https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator/5eb3bf9bac3db90370945f59[registry.connect.redhat.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator^]: Hazelcast Enterprise Operator hosted on Red Hat Container Catalog

There are a few different ways in using Hazelcast Operators:

* kubectl/oc instructions: See the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator[Hazelcast Operator documentation^].
* OpenShift Web Console: OpenShift provides a way to deploy operators from its UI.
* OperatorHub instructions: Check Operator Hub for https://operatorhub.io/operator/hazelcast-operator[Hazelcast^] and https://operatorhub.io/operator/hazelcast-enterprise-operator[Hazelcast Enterprise^].

Since all the Operators mentioned above are generated from Helm Charts, their functionality and input parameters are exactly the same as in the case of Helm Charts.

== Enterprise Operator (Preview)

Hazelcast Enterprise Operator is currently in the early alpha preview stage, but it will soon become the preferred way of installing Hazelcast in Kubernetes/OpenShift environments. For a tutorial, see xref:deploy:deploying-with-operator.adoc[].

== Example Deployment Environments

Explore some example deployment environments and choose one to suit your use case.

=== Embedded Mode

link:https://guides.hazelcast.org/kubernetes-embedded/[Hazelcast Guides: Embedded Hazelcast on Kubernetes].

=== Docker Images

Use the official Hazelcast Docker images:

 * link:https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast/[hazelcast/hazelcast]
 * link:https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise[hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise]
 
Please check link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes Code Samples] for the their usage.

=== Helm Chart

Hazelcast is available in the form of Helm Chart in a few versions:

 * link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast[stable/hazelcast] - Hazelcast IMDG in the official Helm Chart repository
 * link:https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast[hazelcast/hazelcast] - Hazelcast IMDG with Management Center
 * link:https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-enterprise[hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise] - Hazelcast Enterprise with Management Center
 * link:https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/community/hazelcast-enterprise[IBM/hazelcast-enterprise] - Hazelcast Enterprise (with Management Center) dedicated for IBM ICP and IKS environments

You can also check link:https://hub.helm.sh/charts?q=hazelcast[Hazelcast Helm Charts at Helm Hub].

=== Kubernetes/OpenShift Operator

Hazelcast is available as Kubernetes/OpenShift Operator:

 * link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator[hazelcast/hazelcast-operator] - official Hazelcast Operator repository
 * link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/hazelcast-operator[Operator Hub] - official Hazelcast Operator published at Operator Hub

=== Red Hat OpenShift

See link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/openshift[Hazelcast OpenShift Code Samples].

=== Istio

Hazelcast works correctly with Istio >= 1.1.0 without any need of additional configuration. You can use it in both client-server and embedded modes. Also, the Hazelcast cluster can be either outside or inside the Istio mesh. See link:https://guides.hazelcast.org/istio[Hazelcast Guides: Hazelcast with Istio Service Mesh] for the details.
